# flappy-Bird-clone

Hello, I am back and I have made a flappy bird clone. I decided to go for a simpler project and it some how took longer then the 3d snake. Part way through, I started to get bored and took a small break from coding. But I managed to make some thing that I am satisfied with so I figured I shoud just upload this and move on.

Anyway, lets talk about the progress I made with this project. I started geting into drawing pixel art. All the images in the game were drawn by me so if they look weird, it's because this was my first time drawing. 

Another thing I learned to do is create lighting which isn't that complicated, but it makes the game look so much more dynamic. I also combined the vertex and fragment shaders in to one file and it's really conveniant to have both files combined. 

Another thing I did was avoid classes. I wanted to try programing in a more procedral way this time around. I don't think clases are nesacery for small projects like this one. 

Now lets talk about the game, it's flappy bird. you fly through pipes and reset if you hit them. Unfortunatly, I wan't able to make a score system yet. I looked into rendering text, and it seemed really complicated and I just didn't feall like getting into that yet.

Anyway, I'm gonna disapear for a while, again.
